comment: A term for lateral growth has been requested in GO. Lateral meristems contribute to an increase in the cross-sectional area of a shoot axis or root.

[CARO:0000055, POC:curators]
comment: Most multi-tissue plant structures have at least a small connection to other plant structures via a fiat boundary, such as where a leaf (PO:0025034) connects to a shoot axis (PO:0025029), a petal (PO:0009032) connects to a receptacle (PO:0009064), or a branch (PO:0025073) connects to a stem (PO:0009047).

comment: This is a parent term to describe both collective organ part structure (PO:0025269)  (e.g. septum), as well as collective plant organ structure (PO:0025007) (which was formerly named collective plant structure), for example shoot system (PO:0009006).

comment: Includes cardinal parts of plant organs (PO:0025001) as well as parts of other multi-tissue plant structures. Cardinal refers to the fact that these are biologically meaningful and not arbitrary parts. Most cardinal parts of multi-tissue plant structures have both fiat and bona-fide boundaries, including parts with large fiat boundaries, such as leaf base (PO:0020040) or fruit distal end (PO:0008001), and parts with primarily bona-fide boundaries, such as leaflet (PO:0020049).

comment: A whole plant (PO:0000003) in the sporophyte development stage usually has twice the chromosome complement of a plant in the gametophytic phase, but may not in the case of apogamy. Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.

def: "x precedes y if and only if the time point at which x ends is before or equivalent to the time point at which y starts. Formally: x precedes y iff ω(x) <= α(y), where α is a function that maps a process to a start point, and ω is a function that maps a process to an end point." []
