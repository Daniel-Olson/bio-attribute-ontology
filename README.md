# construction

OBA is drawn from various different sources:

 * VT: vertebrate trait ontology (itself partly drawn from the mouse phenotype ontology)
 * TO: plant trait ontology
 * OBA terms partially derived from the `regulation of biological quality` branch of GO
 * OBA terms generated de novo by curators; for example, for curation of [EOL](http://eol.org) trait data in TraitBank
