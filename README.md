# Construction of the Ontology of Biological Attributes

OBA is drawn from various different sources:

* VT: [Vertebrate Trait Ontology](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/vt.html) (itself partly drawn from the mouse phenotype ontology)
* TO: [Plant Trait Ontology](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/to.html)
* OBA terms partially derived from the `regulation of biological quality` branch of the [Gene Ontology (GO)](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/go.html)
* OBA terms generated de novo by curators; for example, for curation of [EOL](http://eol.org) trait data in TraitBank
